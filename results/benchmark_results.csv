This paper presents Dipole, a novel approach for diagnosis prediction in healthcare using attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs). The authors aim to address the challenges of modeling high-dimensional and temporally sequenced Electronic Health Records (EHR) data for improved prediction performance and interpretability.

The proposed method utilizes BRNNs, which can leverage information from both past and future patient visits, addressing the long sequence problem associated with traditional RNNs. However, interpretation of outputs from models incorporating RNNs or BRNNs is infeasible. To overcome this, the authors employ attention-based neural networks to learn the relevance of data samples to the task, providing interpretable results.

The paper compares Dipole with state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction models like RETAIN and GRAM, demonstrating improved predictive performance and interpretability. The study concludes that Dipole offers a promising solution for diagnoses prediction in healthcare, particularly in handling long sequences and providing interpretable results.",0.0137,0.2471910069233683,0.8366199731826782,0.14

**Abstract**

This paper addresses the critical task of predicting future diagnoses using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, a complex problem involving modeling temporally sequenced, high-dimensional clinical information and ensuring model interpretability. Existing methods, such as RETAIN and GRAM, utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but suffer from limitations in handling long patient histories due to RNN forgetfulness. While bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) can mitigate this long-sequence issue by leveraging both past and future context, they lack inherent interpretability. Simpler models like Med2Vec offer interpretability but fail to capture the temporal dynamics of EHR data.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce Dipole, an attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network model. Dipole combines the ability of BRNNs to process sequential data effectively, even for long histories, with an attention mechanism to learn the relevance of different patient visits and medical codes within those sequences. This allows the model to identify key predictive elements, providing crucial interpretability.

Experiments on clinical datasets demonstrate that Dipole significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art RNN-based models (RETAIN, GRAM) and simpler non-temporal methods (Med2Vec). Furthermore, the attention mechanism provides interpretable insights by highlighting the specific patient visits and medical codes contributing most significantly to each prediction, thereby addressing the dual challenge of predictive performance and clinical interpretability.",0.0224,0.245700240898285,0.839131236076355,0.1381
Diagnosis Prediction.pdf,gpt-oss:20b,105.52,"**Abstract**  
Electronic health records (EHR) encode patients’ longitudinal medical histories as temporally ordered visits, each comprising high‑dimensional clinical codes. Predicting future diagnoses from such data is challenging because (i) long sequences degrade the performance of conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and (ii) clinical decision support requires interpretable evidence of which visits and codes drive predictions. We propose **Dipole**, an attention‑based bidirectional recurrent neural network that jointly models the entire visit sequence and learns relevance scores for both visits and individual medical codes. The bidirectional architecture captures context from past and future visits, mitigating the forgetfulness of unidirectional RNNs, while a location‑based attention mechanism assigns interpretable weights that highlight influential visits and codes. Dipole is trained end‑to‑end on real EHR data and evaluated against state‑of‑the‑art baselines (RETAIN, GRAM, Med2Vec). Experimental results demonstrate that Dipole achieves a statistically significant improvement in diagnosis‑prediction accuracy (measured by AUC and F1) across multiple disease cohorts, particularly for patients with long visit histories. Moreover, the learned attention weights provide clinically meaningful explanations, enabling clinicians to trace the model’s reasoning to specific temporal patterns and code combinations. These findings suggest that bidirectional attention‑enhanced RNNs can deliver both superior predictive performance and actionable interpretability for real‑world healthcare applications.",0.0095,0.24685138065313536,0.8321278095245361,0.1227
Diagnosis Prediction.pdf,qwen3:4b,15.5,"This paper addresses the critical challenge of accurately predicting future patient diagnoses from longitudinal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data while maintaining interpretability. Existing state-of-the-art models, such as RETAIN and GRAM, utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal EHR sequence modeling but suffer from significant performance degradation when patient visit histories are long due to RNNs' inherent short-term memory limitations. To overcome this, the authors propose Dipole, an attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) architecture. Dipole leverages the full temporal context of EHR sequences by processing both past and future information within the same model, thereby enhancing predictive capacity for long sequences. Crucially, Dipole integrates an attention mechanism that explicitly weights the relevance of individual patient visits and medical codes to the prediction task. This dual innovation enables the model to achieve superior diagnostic prediction accuracy compared to unidirectional RNNs and provides clinically interpretable insights into which historical visits and medical codes most significantly influence the predicted diagnosis. The results demonstrate that Dipole effectively balances high predictive performance with actionable interpretability, directly addressing the dual challenges of modeling complex temporal EHR data and elucidating the rationale behind prediction outcomes in healthcare applications.

This paper presents Dipole, a novel approach for diagnosis prediction in healthcare using attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs). The study aims to address the challenges of modeling high-dimensional and temporally sequenced Electronic Health Records (EHR) data for improved prediction performance and interpretability.

The authors utilize BRNNs to overcome the limitations of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling long sequences, which significantly improves predictive accuracy. However, interpretation of outputs from models incorporating RNNs or BRNNs is infeasible. To address this issue, the paper employs attention-based neural networks to learn the relevance of data samples and interpret prediction results simultaneously.

The proposed method, RETAIN [11], applies location-based attention to predict future diagnoses. It calculates visit-specific attention weights using medical information from the current visit and the hidden state of the recurrent neural network at that time. This approach allows for the identification of potential risk factors and the design of suitable intervention mechanisms, making it particularly useful in the healthcare domain.

**Abstract**

This paper addresses the critical task of predicting future diagnoses using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, a complex problem involving modeling temporally sequenced, high-dimensional clinical information and ensuring model interpretability. Existing methods, such as RETAIN and GRAM, utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but suffer from limitations in handling long patient histories due to RNN forgetfulness. While bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNNs) can mitigate this long-sequence issue by leveraging both past and future context, they lack inherent interpretability. Simpler models like Med2Vec offer interpretability but fail to capture the temporal dynamics of EHR data.

To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce Dipole, an attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network model. Dipole combines the ability of BRNNs to process sequential data effectively, even for long histories, with an attention mechanism to learn the relevance of different patient visits and medical codes within those sequences. This allows the model to generate interpretable attention weights indicating the importance of specific visits or medical codes for a given prediction.

Experiments on clinical datasets demonstrate that Dipole significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art RNN-based models like RETAIN and GRAM, particularly for longer patient histories. Furthermore, the attention mechanism provides crucial interpretability, enabling the identification of relevant clinical factors contributing to the prediction, thereby enhancing trust and facilitating clinical understanding of the model's reasoning.",0.0231,0.2450980344079201,0.8422061204910278,0.1344,20251125-023435_deepseek-r1_8b

Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide temporally ordered, high‑dimensional clinical data that are essential for predicting future diagnoses. Existing recurrent neural network (RNN)–based models such as RETAIN and GRAM achieve reasonable accuracy but suffer from the forgetfulness of unidirectional RNNs and lack interpretability of the temporal dynamics. This study introduces **Dipole**, an attention‑based bidirectional recurrent neural network that jointly models the forward and backward temporal dependencies of patient visit sequences while assigning learnable relevance scores to both visits and individual medical codes. The bidirectional architecture mitigates the degradation of predictive performance on long sequences, and the attention mechanism yields interpretable weightings that highlight influential visits and diagnoses. Empirical evaluation on large real‑world EHR datasets demonstrates that Dipole outperforms state‑of‑the‑art baselines, achieving higher area‑under‑curve scores, particularly for patients with extended medical histories. The attention weights provide actionable insights into risk factors and temporal patterns, facilitating clinical decision support. In conclusion, Dipole offers a robust, interpretable framework for diagnosis prediction that addresses the challenges of temporal sequence length and high dimensionality inherent in EHR data.",0.0133,0.2186666621206756,0.8342000246047974,0.1445,20251125-065745_gpt-oss_20b
